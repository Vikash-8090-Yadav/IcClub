## üí°Introduction

Investing in promising projects and startups has long been hindered by bureaucracy and high entry barriers, making it difficult for many potential investors. The private investment fund market, valued at $4.6 trillion in 2020, continues to grow, yet remains largely inaccessible to smaller investors.

IC Club aims to change this by leveraging the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) and Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). Our platform allows anyone to invest in projects from anywhere in the world with minimal requirements. Through blockchain technology, IC Club facilitates the creation of investment clubs based on shared interests, ensuring transparency and security.

Join us at IC Club to democratize investment and create a more inclusive financial ecosystem.
 
## üí°Our Vision
IC club  allows you to manage investment clubs, and to spread access to participate in investment funds to anyone, decentralized, agile, and without bureaucracy.Implementing a comprehensive on-chain governance system allows DataDAO members to create and vote on proposals, covering aspects such as member management, dataset storage and distribution, and token distribution. This ensures a democratic and transparent decision-making process within the DAO.



# What it does

## Create Investment Clubs

- Users can easily create investment clubs by providing a club name.
- The club becomes associated with the account of the user who creates it (owner).

## Join or Leave Clubs

- Anyone with an ICP (Internet Computer Protocol) blockchain account can join available investment clubs or leave them with a few clicks.

## Contribute to the Club

- Members can contribute to the common fund (pool) by depositing ICP coins.
- Contributions can be utilized in proposals.

## Create and Vote on Proposals

- Members who contribute funds to the club pool can create proposals.
- Proposals include a description, amount (not exceeding the pool amount), and recipient for potential investments.
- All members can approve or reject proposals with one vote per member on each proposal.

## Run Proposals

- Proposal owners, with greater approval than rejection, can execute proposals.
- This action transfers the proposal amount to the specified recipient.
- Owners can also close proposals for various reasons, such as cancellation or to avoid sending funds.

## üîçThe problem it solves

In the face of systemic challenges within the traditional private investment fund market, IC CLUB emerges as a transformative solution, addressing the longstanding barriers that have hindered the participation of aspiring investors in funding initiatives for innovative projects, including startups.

## üí• Challenges we ran into

**MOTOKO:**
- Building scalable smart contracts is a challenging task that requires hard work and dedication. Despite the difficulties, I was able to make it happen. Our main challenge was to make the contract dynamic and responsive to all users. For instance, if a user adds a course, it should only be visible on their dashboard, not to everyone who logs in to the DApp.
